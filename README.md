# Assessment Questions
1.) Git is a software installed locally on one's system. Specifically, Git is a version control system that lets one manage and keep track of code history. Meanwhile, GitHub is a service hosted on the web. Specifically, GitHub a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. They complement each other in the way that open-source projects that use Git can be managed on GitHub.

2.) A repository is a place that stores one's code, one's files, and the revision history of each file.

3.) Cloning and forking both create a copy of a repository. Cloned repositories contain all of the original repository's data, including versions of every file and folder, and changes made to the clone still directly impact the original repository; this makes cloning ideal for collaboration. Meanwhile, forking creates a new repository with the same code and visibility settings as the original repository, and changes made to the forked repository do not impact the original. Users can still contribute to the original via pull requests. Forking is ideal for playing around with new ideas before they are proposed back to the original repository.

4.)
- Create a branch in the repository, which gives you a space to work without affecting the default branch and collaborators a chance to review your work.
- Make any desired to the repository within the branch you created. Here, you can create, edit, rename, move and delete files, and any changes you make will not carry over to the main branch until you merge the two.
- Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes. This is especially important in repositories that require an approving review from certain users/teams before pull requests can be merged. You should include a summary of the changes and the problem they solve in the pull request
- Reviewers should leave questions, comments, and suggestions. You can continue to commit and push changes in response to the reviews; your pull request will update automatically as you do.
- Once your pull request is reviewed and approved (you may need multiple approving reviews or an approving review from a specific team), you may merge your pull request. This will merge your branch so that your changes appear on the primary branch; the history of comments and commits in the pull request will be retained. After the merge, you should delete your branch.

5.) A pull request asks collaborators on a repository for feedback on your changes. Users or teams can review your work in your branch and add comments......
